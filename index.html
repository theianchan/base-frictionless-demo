      <h1>Frictionless Demo for Base</h1>

      <h3 class="mt--sm">Problem</h3>
      <p>We want the people who want product demos to fill out forms.</p>
      <p>The people who want product demos don't want to fill out forms. They want product demos, and they want them now.</p>

      <h3 class="mt--sm">Solution</h3>
      <p>A form that tells us everything we want to know about the people who want product demos, without them having to tell the form those things.</p>
      <p>The form works by asking the people who want product demos for their email (in this case their company email), and making an API call to an enrichment service with that email, returning with as much information as that enrichment service can provide about the people (and companies) connected to the email.</p>
      <p>For the enrichment service we use Clearbit, but feel free to use any enrichment service you have lying around in your kitchen.</p>

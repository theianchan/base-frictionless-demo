So this demo requires a [Clearbit account](https://clearbit.com), but I'm going to spin up a version that doesn't require one.

# Usage

1. In terminal, go to `frontend`
2. Run `http-server -p 3000`
3. Go to `backend`
4. Create a .env file with `CLEARBIT_KEY=$your_clearbit_key`
5. Run `node server.js`
6. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`
